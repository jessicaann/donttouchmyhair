				<p>
					Don't touch my hair<br>
					When it's the feelings I wear<br>
					Don't touch my soul<br>
					When it's the rhythm I know<br>
					Don't touch my crown<br>
					They say the vision I've found<br>
					Don't touch what's there<br>
					When it's the feelings I wear<br>
					<br>
					They don't understand<br>
					What it means to me<br>
					Where we chose to go<br>
					Where we've been to know<br>
					They don't understand<br>
					What it means to me<br>
					Where we chose to go<br>
					Where we've been to know<br>
					<br>
					You know this hair is my shit,<br> 
					Rolled the rod, I gave it time<br>
					But this here is mine<br>
					You know this hair is my shit,<br> 
					Rolled the rod, I gave it time<br>
					But this here is mine<br>
					<br>
					What you say, oh<br>
					What you say to me<br>
					What you say to me<br>
					What you say to me<br>
					What you say to me<br>
					What you say to me<br>
					What you say to me<br>
					What you say to me<br>
					What you say to me<br>

			<div class="col-3">
				<p>
					Don't touch my pride<br>
					They say the glory's all mine<br>
					Don't test my mouth<br>
					They say the truth is my sound<br>
					<br>
					They don't understand<br>
					What it means to me<br>
					Where we chose to go<br>
					Where we've been to know<br>
					They don't understand<br>
					What it means to me<br>
